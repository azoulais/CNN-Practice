# Facial Expression Recognition<br />
Working with the FER2013 dataset, the goal of this assignment was to empirically see and understand the impact of different architectures and hyper-parameters on prediction over the dataset.<br />
The results are not groundbreaking(not so bad either) but indeed showing the importance of choosing the right parameters.<br />
This assignment was given as part of the course "Deep Learning"(Fall 2022) by Prof. Giuseppe Serra and othe fellows from "AI Lab Udine": http://ailab.uniud.it.
